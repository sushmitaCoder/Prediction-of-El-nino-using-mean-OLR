# Prediction-of-El-nino-using-mean-OLR

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€” the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used. In this project we created a model using linear regression that forecasts El Nino based upon features mainly including Year, Month and Mean OLR)
